        <h2>How is Kombo Administered?</h2>
        <p>
          Kombo is administered by creating small burns on the surface of the skin, typically on the upper arm. The frog secretion is then applied to these burns. The body absorbs the secretion, which induces a strong purgative effect, leading to vomiting and sweating. The entire process usually lasts about 30-45 minutes.

        <h2>What to Expect During a Kombo Session</h2>
        <p>
          During a Kombo session, a practitioner will create small burns on your skin using a heated stick. The Kombo secretion is applied to these burns. The effects are immediate and intense, often causing nausea, vomiting, and sweating. It is important to be well-hydrated before the session and to follow any instructions given by the practitioner.
