        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl">
          Reflexologists believe that certain areas on the feet, hands, and ears are connected to specific organs and body systems. By applying pressure to these areas, they can stimulate energy pathways and promote balance and healing throughout the body. Each session typically lasts about 30-60 minutes.
