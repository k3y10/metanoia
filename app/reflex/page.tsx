          Reflexology is a therapeutic practice that involves applying pressure to specific points on the feet, hands, and ears. These points correspond to different organs and systems in the body. The goal is to promote health and well-being by stimulating the bodyâ€™s natural healing processes.

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl">
          Reflexology has roots in ancient civilizations. Evidence suggests that reflexology was practiced in China and Egypt as early as 2330 BC. Modern reflexology was developed by Dr. William Fitzgerald in the early 20th century, who introduced the concept of "zone therapy."

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl">
          Reflexologists believe that certain areas on the feet, hands, and ears are connected to specific organs and body systems. By applying pressure to these areas, they can stimulate energy pathways and promote balance and healing throughout the body. Each session typically lasts about 30-60 minutes.

        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl">
          During a reflexology session, you will typically lie down or sit comfortably. The reflexologist will use their hands to apply pressure to various points on your feet, hands, or ears. Some people may feel slight discomfort during the session, but it should not be painful. Many people find reflexology to be relaxing and rejuvenating.
